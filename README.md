# Algora
https://algora01.streamlit.app/

Algora is a web-based tool built with Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn that simplifies the process of building and comparing machine learning models. Users can upload a dataset (CSV or Excel), define which columns to use, and select a target variable. The app automatically handles data cleaning tasks—such as imputing missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical ones—using libraries like pandas and scikit-learn.

For both regression and classification tasks, Algora offers a range of algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Linear/Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees) with options for hyperparameter tuning via Grid Search. It provides clear visualizations including scatter plots, heatmaps, and confusion matrices to help you understand model performance. Additionally, you can download the trained models and even input custom data for making new predictions.

In short, Algora bridges advanced machine learning processes with a user-friendly interface, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users.
